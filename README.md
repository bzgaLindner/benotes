# benotes
Public and private backend notes for TYPO3

## Introduction
### What does it do?
This extension sets up a new module “Notes” within the user modules, which enables the editors to write categorized private and public notes. Writing notes is empowered by TYPO3 integrated ckeditor. Backend Notes is based on Extbase and Fluid and works with typo3 12.4

## Users manual
Go to the new Notes Module at Users->Notes 
Create one or more Categories first by selecting “Create Category“ from the top menu
Create a new Note by selecting “Create Note” and assign a category to it – you can decide if the Note should be private or public
Warning! Public Notes can be deleted by everyone!
